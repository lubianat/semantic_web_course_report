## Abstract {.page_break_before}


PanglaoDB is an online data base of cell-type markers compiled from single-cell RNA-sequencing studies. The database is available via a Graphical User Interface and provides a csv to download. The database was published in 2019 is widely used, amassing 81 citations to date (via Google Scholar). The content, however, only reaches 3 stars in the Berners-Lee 5-star scale for Linked Open Data (LOD), as it is neither available as RDF, nor enriched with links to other semantic resources. In this work, I reconciled to Wikidata a subset of the database corresponding to the markers of human cell types. I then show that the upgrade of the data to 5-star LOD makes it amenable to SPARQL queries that provide new insights on the data. This study case displays the benefits of releasing biomedical knowledge bases as semantically-enriched, Wikidata-linked, 5 star Linked Open Data.

# Introduction

PanglaoDB [@https://panglaodb.se/index.html] [@doi:10.1093/database/baz046] is a public database that contains data and metadata on different types of cells. The types of cells are associated with marker genes, which are used to identify the classes that best fit cells observed in biomedical experiments.

Despite its usefulness for the community, the database is on a 3-star category for Linked Open Data [@url:https://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/LinkedData.html] as it does not use open standards from W3C (RDF and SPARQL). To make it 5-star, it needs to be also linked to external data via common identifiers. 


The OBO Foundry provides a rich collection of linked biological identifiers [@url:http://www.obofoundry.org/]. However, reconciliation to OBO is challenging, as there are many ontologies, each with slightly different contribution guidelines. For that reason, we decided to reconcile PanglaoDB to Wikidata, which allows simple creation of new terms, provided they follow Wikidata`s notability criteria[@url:https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Notability].
